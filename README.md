# SnackBarUndo

Library to make the items in a `RecyclerView` dismissable with the possibility to undo
it, using the `SnackBar` to provide this functionality like the Google Messeger app for Android does.

**Gradle**

Add the following to your `build.gradle`:

    allprojects {
        repositories {
		    ...
		    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	}

	dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.andela-gkuti:SnackBarUndo:v1.0'
	}
	
**Maven**:

Add the JitPack repository to your build file

    <repositories>
		  <repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		  </repository>
	 </repositories>
	 
	 <dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.andela-gkuti</groupId>
	    <artifactId>SnackBarUndo</artifactId>
	    <version>v1.0</version>
	</dependency>


NOTE that the library should be used with a `Cordinator layout` as your root.


Usage
==============
Create and instance of SnackBarUndo
```java
    SnackBarUndo snackBarUndo = new SnackBarUndo(list,coordinatorLayout,AdapterClass.this);
```

In your project delete method call the snackBarUndo.delete() method and pass in the adapter position using `getAdapterPosition()` and SnackBarUndoCallback()
```java
void delete(){
    snackBarUndo.delete(getAdapterPosition(), new SnackBarUndoCallback() {
        @Override
        public void deleteData() {
            //code to delete the item when undo wasn't clicked
        }
    });
}
```
